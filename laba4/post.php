      "Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind
      of
      their white covering of frost, and they seemed
      to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The
      land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement,
      so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but
      of
      a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that
      was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of
      infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of
      eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted
      Northland Wild",

      "But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.
      Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the
      air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and
      formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and
      leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made
      of
      stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front
      end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that
      surged
      like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and
      narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but
      prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.",

      "In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On the
      sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the
      Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild
      to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and
      the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the
      sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and
      most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most
      restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must
      in the end come to the cessation of movement.",

      "But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their bodies were
      covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were
      so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the
      seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral
      of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence,
      puny
      adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might
      of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space.",
